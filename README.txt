Code Challenge

My code doesnâ€™t have any dependencies; it is simply divided into two files:
1-	graph.py, which includes the functions that construct the graph, calculate the average vertex and arrange the list that is passed to the graph function to keep the 60s window.
2-	load_array.py,  which reads the input file and pass it to the functions that process it

I have added a test case called example_test in which I have created an input file that generate the graph in the example provided in the coding challenge and compared the output of the program with the output provided. So the test results was:
[PASS]: example_test
[PASS]: test-2-tweets-all-distinct

Thank you for the interesting problem
